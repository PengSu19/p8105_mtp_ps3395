The raw “COA” dataset captures monthly data on the total number of COAs
entering and leaving each ZIP code in NYC from 2018 to 2022.
Additionally, the “ZIP codes” data contains information on the boroughs
and neighborhoods, totaling 324 observations, including NAs.

This report aims to analyze the COA changes in NYC between 2018 and
2022.

  )
```

COA data from different years were consolidated into a single `COA`
dataset, and a `year` variable was extracted from `month`. Also,
`net_change` variable was created to represent the difference between
inbound and outbound COAs. For `zip` dataset, `borough` was derived from
the `county_name`. Subsequently, the `zip` and `COA` were merged to
`merge_df` based on ZIP codes and duplicates in `zip` were removed to
ensure data quality. Furthermore, the borough was changed according to
the corresponding county, and characters such as `borough` were
converted to lowercase.

After the cleaning, `merge_df` now comprises a total of 11845
observations, encompassing 237 unique ZIP codes and 43 neighborhoods.

Table 2, most common values of city in the borough of Queens

Tables 1 and 2 present the most common cities in Manhattan and Queens.
Comparing with Queens, Manhattan’s data indicates a significant
disparity in the number of cities which may be attributed to variations
in the number of neighborhoods within each city.

Many ZIP codes in `zip` had fewer observations and included NA values
for neighborhoods. This can be attributed to regional variations in
geographical location and socioeconomic factors affecting data
collection. For instance, city like New York of Manhattan have the
resources to consistently report data, given their high population
density, resulting in 60 months of available data. Conversely, remote
rural neighborhoods often lack such resources, leading to limited data
collection. Additionally, geographically remote ZIP codes may not
collect neighborhood data as comprehensively as highly developed cities
may also contributing to the absence of neighborhood information.

Table 3, the average of ‘net_change’ in each borough and year

Table 3 shows that average `net_change` decreased in all boroughs except
Staten Island, reaching their lowest points in 2020. This suggests that,
there were significantly more permanent address changes moving out of
each ZIP code than moving in.

Figure 1 displays a five-year trend of average `net_change` across ZIP
codes within neighborhoods, with different colors representing distinct
neighborhoods. Notably, all boroughs, except for Staten Island, exhibit
relatively similar moving trends. The majority of the time shows a
negative `net_change`, suggesting more people moved out of ZIP codes
than into them. This negative trend intensified from 2020 to 2021,
indicating a substantial increase in people leaving neighborhoods. The
trend is most pronounced in Manhattan, with notable outliers around
2020. Staten Island’s moving trends remained fairly steady from 2018 to
2022.

However, this dataset lacks the initial population data. This limitation
makes it challenging to assess the changes in the context of the entire
population. Therefore, it’s difficult to accurately determine the
overall population size changes. Additionally, the levels of ZIP codes
can complicate the interpretation of population changes. Visualizing the
data by neighborhoods may offer a more comprehensible perspective.
